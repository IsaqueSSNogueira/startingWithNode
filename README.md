# Simple Shopping List CRUD

I developed a simple Node.js shopping list project that starts with default items and allows you to add (POST), edit (PUT), and delete (DELETE) products. The list is automatically updated with each change, with data stored only in memory.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.  
2. Run the server with `node index.js` (or seu arquivo principal) on port 3000.  
3. The frontend is built with React and communicates with the Node.js backend.  
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the app.
